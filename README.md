Industrial Training Program 2021 -
    1. Artificial Intelligence with Python
    2. Data Science with Python
</pre>**

## Artificial Intelligence with Python:

#### What we learned?
The training started with Python, then exploring its libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, tensorflow, pytorch). 
After that we learned about file system (os module). Then we learned Machine Learning concepts. 

#### The Projects I created:
The **minor project** was based on simply solving the questions on Python and its libraries.

For the **major ptoject**, we had to choose our own topic and create a model. So I chose **_DCGAN_ (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network)**.
There is a attached report that tells all about it.

## Data Science with Python:

#### What we learned?
The training started with Python, then exploring its libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, tensorflow). 
Then we learned Machine Learning concepts - Linear regression, logistic regression,  

#### The Projects I created:
The **minor project** was to create **the _Alien Invasion_ game**. <br>
Library used - Pygame <br>
IDE used - Pycharm <br>
Reference - Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. <br>

For the **major ptoject**, we had to make either "Claffication model" or "CNN model" or "RNN model".
I made the **Cryptocurrency-predicting RNN Model**.
